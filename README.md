## What Are Monopoly Go Free Dice?

Free dice are one of the most sought-after resources in Monopoly Go. Dice rolls are used to determine your movement on the game board, and you only have a limited number of dice rolls available per day. This can sometimes feel restrictive, especially if you're enjoying a long session of the game or trying to make significant progress. 

Free dice allow you to bypass these restrictions, enabling you to continue playing without having to wait for new dice rolls to refresh or purchase more via in-app purchases. These free dice rolls are essential for players who want to stay in the game and avoid interruptions during gameplay.
